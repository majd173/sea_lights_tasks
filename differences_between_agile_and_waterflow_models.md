# Task no. 2
## SDLC â€“ Agile & Waterflow
### Differences between two models:
### Agile										      |	 Waterflow
#### Requires an intensive involvement from stakeholders	                              |  Does not require an involvement from stakeholders like agile
#### Has an option to reduce costs if the requirements are clear and the flow goes well.   |	 May be more expensive because of the feedback loops.
#### Suitable for dynamic projects with continuous changes	                              |  Suitable for well-defined and stable projects with clear requirements
#### A flexible model which can manage immediate changes in any phase	              |  A rigid model which may be hard to manages immediate changes in any phase 
#### Manages feedback anytime because of being separated into small pieces	              |  Can not manage feedback because of being a sequential model
